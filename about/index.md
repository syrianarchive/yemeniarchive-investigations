# Mission

Through collecting, preserving, verifying and investigating open source content relating to human rights violations in Yemen, the Yemeni Archive will create a database of materials with an added value to be used for supporting advocacy research, assisting in legal case building, and constructing digital memory for Yemen through the materials.

### Research methodology is based on the following core principles:

#### First: Content identification, acquisition and standardisation

Yemeni Archive discovers relevant sources of information and aggregates them in a structured way. The acquisition is done in two different ways:

- By building collaboration with journalists, lawyers and human rights activists to acquire and preserve their material.
- By acquiring material which is published on social media platforms and other websites on a daily basis.

#### Second: Secure long term preservation

Yemeni Archive preserves visual documentation of human rights abuses in Yemen committed by all actors by storing them on a secure server online and with offline backups. Working with low-cost and reliable hosting partners, in addition to open source software will help to ensure the long-term sustainability of the storage, ensuring the material will continue to be available for analysis now and in the future to advance justice, accountability and reconciliation efforts.

#### Third: Verification, cataloging and metadata enrichment

Yemeni Archive organises preserved materials by cataloging content according the following categories

- Attacks against hospitals
- Attacks against schools
- Attacks against bakeries
- Attacks against journalists
- Attacks against markets
- Attacks against mosques
- Attacks against cultural property
- Attacks against civilians
- Attacks against water sources
- Attacks against humanitarian relief personnel and objects
- Civilian casualties as a result of alleged coalition attacks
- Civilian casualties as a result of alleged attacks by armed groups
- Civilian casualties as a result of alleged attacks by Yemeni government forces
- Civilian casualties as a result of alleged attacks by pro-Yemeni government forces
- Plunder and theft
- Coalition airstrikes in Yemen

Additional value is added to the material by recording as much metadata and chain of custody information as possible, including **location, date and origin**. This contextualises material by addressing the questions of **when, where and what happened in a specific incident which will help viewers to identify and understand it**.

#### Fourth: Accessibility and raising awareness

Yemeni Archive makes the material **open, accessible and fully searchable** for use by human rights advocates, journalists, researchers, investigators, lawyers and historians to promote discussions, debate and raise awareness on issues related to human rights, justice, equality, and accountability in Yemen . There will also be engagement with citizen journalists, activists, lawyers and human rights organisations **to establish best practices in preservation, verification and conducting open source investigations**.
