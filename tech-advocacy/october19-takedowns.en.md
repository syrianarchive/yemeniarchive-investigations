To date, Yemeni Archive has preserved and processed 396,445 videos from YouTube and 102,827Twitter posts. This demonstrates an increase of 238,831 videos from YouTube and 53,478 posts from Twitter since October 2019. Unfortunately, despite many documenting human rights violations, many of these videos have been  [made unavailable](https://yemeniarchive.org/en/tech-advocacy)  for a variety of reasons.

Yet 36,680 YouTube videos remain unavailable as of October 2019. Some of these videos include attacks on refugee camps, attacks on hospitals and medical facilities, or destruction of civilian infrastructure. These 24,242 videos and 70 Twitter posts are securely preserved by Yemeni Archive and available upon request.

Yemeni Archive preserves content from 252 YouTube channels and 58 Twitter channels on a daily basis. This demonstrates an increase of 31 YouTube channels since June 2019. Of these, 3 YouTube channels channels have been made unavailable as of October 2019 but are preserved in Yemeni Archive infrastructure. Some of these channels are long-standing media houses that have been documenting human rights violations in Yemen since 2014.

Social media platforms have become accidental archives, but takedowns have proven they are no place for long-term, safe storage of materials depicting human rights violations. Alternate strategies must be used to archive this material, and Yemeni Archive seeks to fill this gap.

Get in touch if you or your media organisation has been affected by content takedowns on YouTube or other social media platforms or need assistance in securely archiving documentation materials.
