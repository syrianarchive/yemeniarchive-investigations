To date, Yemeni Archive has preserved and processed 439,876 videos from YouTube and 183,797 Tweets. Many of these have been [made unavailable](https://yemeniarchive.org/en/tech-advocacy) for a variety of reasons. 

61,133 YouTube videos have been made unavailable as of April 2020. Some of these videos include attacks on refugee camps, attacks on hospitals and medical facilities, or destruction of civilian infrastructure. These 61,133 videos and 183,797 Tweets are securely preserved by Yemeni Archive and available upon request.

Yemeni Archive preserves content from YouTube channels on a daily basis. Social media platforms have become accidental archives, but takedowns have proven they are no place for long-term, safe storage of materials depicting human rights violations. Alternate strategies must be used to archive this material, and Yemeni Archive seeks to fill this gap.

Get in touch if you or your media organisation has been affected by content takedowns on YouTube or other social media platforms or need assistance in securely archiving documentation materials.
