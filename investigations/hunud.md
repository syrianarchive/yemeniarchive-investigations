To verify the caused destruction in Al-Hunud market neighbourhood, the Google Earth archive was searched for images of the targeted area before and after the incident.

Below, satellite image published on 28 September 2016 showing damage to buildings as a result of the air strike

To better assess the damage, Yemeni Archive team created 3D images of the buildings that were damaged.

<iframe frameborder="0" class="juxtapose" width="100%" height="800px" src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=2bbc2318-5182-11e9-8106-0edaf8f81e27"></iframe>

Most of the claims in the news and the visual documents reported that the attack occurred through airstrikes launched by coalition aircraft on several sites, including an airstrike on Al-Hunud market neighbourhood. Yemeni Archive has found a photograph documenting one of the remnants of the munitions used in the attack, but it is not possible to determine its type. However, it is likely to be part of a rocket, which corresponds to one of the testimonies mentioned that a rocket targeted the condolence tent. [In the video published by Al-Yemen TV channel](https://youtu.be/soPDcABHqfk?t=157), a woman stated at 2:37:   "We were sitting in the condolence tent when a rocket hit and destroyed these houses, what is the guilt of the children, the women, and the innocents, what is our fault?"

![](/assets/investigations/Hunud/image6.png)

Yemeni Archive used the satellite images to calculate the affected area by the attack, and it was approximately 2,800 square meters. By asking one of the weapons experts. It was observed that the area and the scale of the destruction in the area corresponded to the impact usually caused by airstrikes, as ground or artillery bombing can not cause similar destruction.

### Civilian casualties caused by the attack

At 23:38 on 21 September 2016 [Al-Khabar news agency published](http://khabaragency.net/news72474.html0) a report stated that on the evening of the same day, Saudi airstrikes targeted a condolence tent in Al-Hunud market neighbourhood in Hudaydah city, resulting in about 90 civilians were killed and injured in an initial death toll, then the report was updated indicating that the number rose to 22 killed and 131 injured according to a statement from a source in the health operations.

## Conclusion

After collecting and analysing visual documentation published on social media platforms and news networks, Yemeni Archive determined that Al-Hunud market neighbourhood in Hudaydah governorate was targeted by air strikes on September 21st, 2016.

According to the analysed evidence and sources, several air strikes targeted the surroundings of the Republican Palace, the last airstrike took place in AL-Hunud market neighbourhood, where a number of civilian houses were destroyed, resulting in deaths and injuries.

The attack began around 19:00 that day targeting the buildings of the Central Security, Air Defense, and Criminal Investigation. Al-Hunud market neighbourhood was targeted at about 21:00, resulting in 24 killed and 115 injured, including women and children. The nearby civilian buildings were additionally destroyed, as well as damage to ambulances during rescue operations.

 Several reports have indicated Coalition forces’ responsibility for targeting. Despite Yemeni Archive not finding open source content indicating the forces allegedly responsible for the attack, the coalition led airstrikes and [destroying of Houthi controlled airports and aircraft](https://www.presstv.com/Detail/2015/03/30/404030/Saudiled-jets-target-Sanaa-airport) strongly indicates that coalition forces are responsible for the attack.

### Methodology of using tools in this investigation:

1. We used [whopostedwhat](https://whopostedwhat.com) to gather more accurate information about the incident and its timing, by searching for what was first published about it.

2. We analysed the timestamps of Facebook posts using the [4webhelp tool](http://www.4webhelp.net/us/timestamp.php) in order to verify the timing of their publication in Yemen local time and to verify the source.

3. To verify that the attack actually occurred, we used historical images from [Google Earth Pro](https://www.google.com/earth/) and then analysed the incident-related visual documents and matched them with the satellite images, confirming that the attack took place in that area.

4. To verify the location of the incident, we compared the places shown in the related pictures and videos to identify the landmarks, the most important of which was a mosque.

5. Using the [masajid tool](https://www.masajid.fr/index.php/) we found the name of the mosque and its geographical location.

6. We identified the impact of the attack on civilians by collecting the names of the victims posted on the social media platforms, verifying and analysing the materials using the [checkmedia tool](http://checkmedia.org) tool.

7. Yemeni Archive team created 3D images of the buildings that were targeted to better assess the damage and to calculate the total destroyed area, in an attempt to determine the type of the used weapon by weapons experts.
