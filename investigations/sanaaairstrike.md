One man was renting a room in the building whose his legs were cut. He died between my arms. They are all from the same family.” The video shows one of the killed children found under the rubble and carried to the ambulance.

# Where it Happened

Because of the significant landmarks surrounding the residential area, this airstrike was geolocated to a [small building in the district of al-Raqas in western Sana’a](https://goo.gl/maps/qNdLzf6Rh2YL8VuPA). The building stands across from the Maaz Bin Jabal school which can be seen in the background of the footage showing the aftermath of the attack. The attack site also neighbors the district’s public market and other residential buildings.

This report lists around 55 individuals with identified injuries as well as 6 deaths. This matches reports, such as that by [RT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_Hc_ur9sBs), which detail a family with four children as having died as a result of the airstrike.

# Statements/Narrative

Given the controversies regarding this attack on civilians, two predominant narratives held by Ansarallah and the Saudi coalition dominate discussions regarding this event. Firstly, the Saudi coalition concentrates discussions regarding this airstrike, and the other airstrikes occurring in the capital on May 16th, upon an [attack](https://www.aljazeera.net/news/politics/2019/5/19/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%B9%D9%88%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A3%D9%86%D8%A8%D9%88%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%81%D8%B7-%D8%A3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%83%D9%88-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D9%88%D8%AB%D9%8A-%D8%B5%D9%88%D8%B1-%D8%A3%D9%82%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D8%B5%D8%B7%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B9%D9%8A%D8%A9) ARAMCO oil processing stations (Aramco 8 and 9) located in Saudi Arabia by drone breaking their pipelines as [reported by Saudi-funded Al-Arabiya News](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BC5FfctAp2M).

![](/assets/investigations/sanaa/image32.png)

A [report by Al-Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.net/news/politics/2019/5/19/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%B9%D9%88%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A3%D9%86%D8%A8%D9%88%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%81%D8%B7-%D8%A3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%83%D9%88-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D9%88%D8%AB%D9%8A-%D8%B5%D9%88%D8%B1-%D8%A3%D9%82%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D8%B5%D8%B7%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B9%D9%8A%D8%A9) details the damage done by the drone strikes on the oil stations and emphasizes a direct and accurate targeting of the Aramco 8 and 9 pipelines by the Houthis. The Yemeni Archive team was able to verify the damage of Aramco 8 through geolocation using DigitalGlobe satellite imagery taken on 19-05-2019 and finding the damage as shown below:

The anti-Hadi pro-Houthi Republic of Yemen Armed Forces broadcasted a [statement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2RfM5Kyg9M) detailing the attack and emphasizing their attempts to economically disable the enemy country of Saudi Arabia. Naming the drone strike which disabled the pipelines as an act of direct aggression, and a violation of international law, the Saudi coalition justified the [airstrikes](https://www.alarabiya.net/ar/arab-and-world/yemen/2019/05/17/%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%AF%D9%8A%D9%88-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81-%D9%8A%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%AF%D9%81-%D9%85%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%B9-%D8%B9%D8%B3%D9%83%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%AD%D9%88%D8%AB%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D8%B5%D9%86%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%A1) throughout the city claiming their aim as [“neutralizing the ability of the Houthi militia to carry out acts of aggression.”](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-strikes/saudi-led-coalition-in-yemen-strikes-sanaa-casualties-reported-idUSKCN1SM0F0)

Differing from the Saudi narrative, Ansarallah emphasized the innocence of victims of the May 16th attack in both a [statement](https://twitter.com/AnsarAllahMC/status/1129139703817613313) as well as a [video report](https://twitter.com/AnsarAllahMC/status/1129130054104096768). In their statement regarding the attack, Ansarallah describes the injuries from the airstrike as including the head of the Yemeni Media Union, in addition to the death of his son. The group claims the attack was an attempt to silence the voices of the Yemeni people and reaffirms the commitment of Yemeni media to continue reporting on the suffering of their people.

Moreover, the medical aid organization MSF published a [statement](https://twitter.com/msf_yemen/status/1129012650728402944) on Twitter noting the influx of patients in their hospitals (48 injured and 4 dead) as a result of airstrikes on the 16th. [RT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_Hc_ur9sBs) and [France 24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=11&v=rV66l5tJCr4) additionally detail the airstrikes led by the Saudi coalition as in response to Houthi attacks on Saudi oil pipelines.

# Conclusion

Given the media verified in this report, the Yemeni Archive can conclude that an airstrike on a [residential building in al-Raqas, Sana’a](https://goo.gl/maps/qNdLzf6Rh2YL8VuPA) did occur on May 16 2019. The attack most likely occurred at around 08:16 Sana’a local time and killed 6 civilians, 4 of them children, as well as injured at least 33 civilians. The attack severely damaged the targeted building as well as a neighboring school and nearby residential buildings. It led to a propagation of differing narratives regarding the attack. This attack occurred shortly after Houthi forces broke, by drone strike, 2 ARAMCO oil pipelines in Saudi Arabia. Shortly after this Houthi attack, the Kingdom claimed airstrikes in Sana’a were necessary to neutralize Houthi aggression. Ansarallah claims the attacks led by the Saudi’s on Sana’a was an attack on Yemeni freedoms and an attempt to silence the Yemeni people. Nevertheless despite the lack of open sources which fully verify who committed this attack in al-Raqas, it is likely, given statements by Saudi Arabia regarding the earlier Houthi attacks on ARAMCO pipelines, that the Saudi-led coalition is responsible for the attack.
