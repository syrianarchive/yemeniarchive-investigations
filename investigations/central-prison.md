## Witnesses:



The Yemeni Archive team interviewed victims, officials, and workers linked to the incident in Taiz Central Prison and citizens living in the area, and listened to their testimonies, and according to one of the wounded – who preferred not to mention her name, she said: "We were in sitting in the prison yard with my friends as a group meeting before being released, after an order for our release was issued. We kept talking and laughing and suddenly a shell fell, I went to the room to fetch water and rushed to the outside. I saw a horrific and very ugly scene, the remains and blood of my friends were scattered, and their bodies were thrown around the place. I tried to rescue the policewoman when another shell fell and I got shrapnel in my hand.”

Samar al-Marwani, a pseudonym, one of the residents west of the city and close to the front lines, said:

> “I heard the sound of the first projectile that went from the
> direction of the al-Rubaie area, the center of the Houthis’ presence.
> I stood in front of the house as a second projectile proceeded towards
> the thirtieth Street. I made a telephone call to know where exactly
> the explosion took place, and they told me that it was in the central
> prison. I went there while, and while I was there a third projectile
> landed in the corner of the prison. "



Sergeant Thani Tawfiq Ali, a soldier working in the prison, said: "At about four o'clock in the afternoon we were near the women's prison when the shell reached the interior, we went to the wing gate, and we found 7 women dead 8 wounded with amputated feet and hands. One of them was a policewoman who was performing the service and she passed away. Two days after the incident, as we were there another shell landed near the place and the third followed it a little further away, at the same time a shell landed at the prison gate killing a truck driver. The total of the shells that landed on the fifth of April is 6 shells inside and around the prison.

Fragments of the first shell flew in all directions of the yard, but according to the photos published by Khaled Fouad Al-Bena on his Facebook page, the comparison shows the two sides most affected by the attack and the location of the main gathering of inmates.



## Verification:

The Yemeni Archive team has verified the visual content shown in the videos and photos of the women's wing in Taiz Central Prison taken by the team and were posted on the social media, and analyzed and compared geographical features with satellite images.



It is clear that the features of the women's wing building in Taiz Central Prison and the background terrain taken from Google Earth are identical to the features and terrain of the target location of the attack in the photos taken by the Archive team.

The features of the women's wing yard appear in satellite imagery match the details of the building in the photos taken by the Yemeni Archive team, where an water steel reservoir is seen on the roof of the women's building towards the columns indicated, and we see water delivery pipes to the end of the square in the interior image of the wing. This explains the correlation of the available visual evidence about the location of the attack.

## The weapon used:



The Yemeni Archive team was able to obtain photos of the weapon remains used in the attack, collected by the Central Prison Administration in Taiz, which are 120-mm mortar structures and parts of fragments. According to a study conducted about mortars and published by the Geneva International Center for Mine Clearance ([GICHD](http://characterisationexplosiveweapons.org/studies/annex-c-81-82-120-mm-mortars/)), the 120-mm caliber is considered heavy artillery, and its range ranges between 7 - 9 km and contains between 1.7 - 4.2 kg of iron. The distance between Taiz Central Prison and the nearest site controlled by the "Ansar Allah" Houthi group is about 2 km, on the back of the strategic Mount Han overlooking the city's only road, that is, in the range of which the cannon reaches.

The Houthi group, "Ansar Allah", took control of the warehouses of the Yemeni army and security forces in the beginning of the year 2015, most of which were Russian-made weapons and mortars including mortars of various calibers, and was used in the ongoing conflict between the group and the Saudi-backed legal forces in Yemen.



The "Ansar Allah" group revealed on April 22, 2018 that it manufactured various artillery and shells that included locally made mortars called "Rajum", in addition to manufacturing mortars of various calibres. A video on Al Masirah TV showed models of the declared shells that correspond to the remnants of the shell that fell on the central prison and others. The Popular Resistance Forces in Taiz announced that they were found at a Houthi site in the southern countryside of the city in 2015.

Conclusion:

After analyzing the open source content posted on social media, satellite TV channels, and news websites, in addition to testimonies of victims and people associated with the incident and the investigation team's documentation of the target location, it can be said that Taiz Central Prison was attacked on April 5, 2020, with three 120-mm mortar shells, one of which hit the women's ward between 16:30 - 16:57 pm local time, killed 8 people, including two children who were visiting their families, and wounded 7 others.

Local and international parties accuse the forces of the "Ansar Allah" group, the Houthis, of their responsibility for the attack on Taiz Central Prison from its locations in the outskirts of the city, where the nearest military site is located about 2 km from the target location, as well as testimonies of citizens living near the contact lines west of the city stated that the sounds of firing shells came from the direction of the al-Rubaie area, which is under the group's control.

Through the analysis of the weapon in use, it is clear that the "Ansar Allah" group, the Houthis, possesses this type of projectile, which it uncovered in a report by Al-Masirah channel, and said it was locally made by their military industrial workshop.
