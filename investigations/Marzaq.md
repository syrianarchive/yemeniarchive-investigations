## Introduction

Al-Mazraq camp is located in the Al-Mazraq area, next to the Al-Mazraq market in Haradh district of [Hajjah governorate](https://goo.gl/maps/UrdCc7LnA792), adjacent to Sa'dah from the west. It was established in 2009 by the United Nations to accommodate civilians displaced from areas of conflict in the Sa'dah governorate due to the wars that were taking place there. It houses about 12,500 displaced people, mostly women and children. At the end of March 2015, and due to the escalation of the situation in the north especially in Sa'dah governorate as a result of multiple wars between the Houthis and the government, many families (about 500) fled that area and arrived at Al Mazraq Camp.

On April 4, 2015, [the Legal Center for Rights and Development published a report](http://www.lcrdye.org/2015/04/04/%D9%82%D8%B5%D9%81-%D9%85%D8%AE%D9%8A%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B2%D8%B1%D9%82-%D9%84%D9%84%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B2%D8%AD%D9%8A%D9%86-%D8%AD%D8%B1%D8%B6-%D8%AD%D8%AC%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D8%AA%D8%A7/) on Al-Mazraq camp attack, in which many testimonies confirmed that the airstrikes took place around 11 am on Monday, 30 March 2015, including the testimony of the injured Mohammed Shua’i Jamil Amina, who stated that the shelling of Al-Mazraq camp started at about 11 am by an airstrike on the gate of the camp, “Muhammad fled with displaced people from the camp next to the bridge on the main road, then a new airstrike took a place and Mohammad escaped with the others toward a hotel, where they have been attacked again. Mohammad’s right leg was injured and amputated, in addition to many wounds in his body.“

To verify the time of the [Yemen Today Tv’s video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSvkFY3L_Js), an analysis of sun shadows was conducted in the Al-Mazraq area on 30 March 2015 between 11:03 and 14:12 Yemen local time using the [SunCalc](https://www.suncalc.org/) tool. The direction of the Sun determined through the SunCalc tool is consistent with the shadows of buildings shown in the Yemen Today Tv’s video and photos published in social media, which confirms what has been reported by citizens and correspondents that Al-Mazraq camp attack occurred on March 30, 2015, around 11:22 pm. Below is a screenshot of SunCalc analysis:

To further verify the time of the published videos and images,  Al-Mazraq weather analysis was conducted on 30 March 2015 between 12:00 and 22:00 Yemen local time, using the [WolframAlpha tool](https://www.wolframalpha.com/). The weather specified by the tool is consistent with the weather in videos and photos posted via social media related to the incident, reinforcing what has been reported. Below is a screenshot of the WolframAlpha analysis:

## Where did it happen?

### geolocating and landmarks

To determine the exact targeted location, the Yemeni archive collected, verified, identified the landmarks in the incident-related visual documentation, and matched them with satellite images taken to the Al-Mazraq area.
Below is a picture that was published by several news networks showing transferring victims’ bodies by Red Crescent paramedics in front of the camp gate.  In the background, two buildings were marked in green and yellow as landmarks, as well as a nearby mosque minaret which was marked in red.

Footage from a [video published by the NCTP channel on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N49PXMh7maY) shows a corpse at the entrance to the camp gate. The minaret, one of the identified landmarks, can be seen in the background.

In the [video published by Yemen Today Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcm4JDSvu3Q), the same identified landmarks are shown. After the analysis, it was ascertained that the footage below was taken from inside Al-Mazrak Camp No. 1, where the tents of the displaced people and the marked landmarks can be seen, which are matching with the satellite images. The Yemeni Archive evaluated the location of the camera as well as the direction of the photographer (towards the impact site) using Google Earth.

The closest photos to the attack date in Google Earth were on 18/9/2013 before the air strike and 29/1/2016 after it, where The camp gate and the administration building of the camp appear in both pictures. By comparison, the destruction caused by the attack in the area can be observed.

## Positions of different parties about the incident

[In a press conference held on April 1, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWG2IlaUbdU), Major General Ahmad Asiri, the spokesman for the military Coalition Forces, denied the responsibility of the coalition for targeting the camp. He confirmed the Coalition's knowledge of both civilian and military places. Al-Asiri blamed the attack on mortars shelling by the al-Houthi group.

[In an interview with Al-Hadath TV channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjjc9J-q4K8), the Yemeni government, represented by the then Yemeni Foreign Minister Dr. Riyad Yassin, also denied the responsibility of the coalition for the attack. Instead, it blamed the targeting the camp on al-Houthis.

In turn, The al-Houthi group [through its official channels](http://www.ansarollah.com/archives/tag/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%85%D9%86/page/96) accused the coalition of targeting civilians in the Al-Mazraq camp.

The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said [in its report on 7 September 2015](https://www.ohchr.org/en/hrbodies/hrc/regularsessions/session30/documents/a_hrc_30_31_aev.docx) that the information gathered by OHCHR indicated that on 30 March 2015, the coalition forces launched a number of  air strikes that hit the Al-Mazraq IDP camp, resulting in many killed and injured civilians, and that the information provided to OHCHR did not identify the presence of any military objectives in that area.

*Paragraph of the report issued by OHCHR about of Al-Mazraq camp incident*

The response to the UN report, which condemned the coalition of targeting al-Mazraq camp, was made by Mansur al-Mansur, head of the Coalition Accident Assessment Committee in Yemen, [at a press conference held in Riyadh on February 23, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bH5EfAJV8uU). He said that Al-Mazraq was an area prohibited from being targeted by coalition forces, and that based on the intelligence of the coalition forces, there is no military activity in the camp. Al-Mansour pointed out that the coalition forces targeted at that time a gathering and observation point belonging to the Houthis in Jabal Haidan overlooking the Saudi city of Khouba, which is 35 kilometers away from the Al-Mazraq camp, and attached a satellite image of the mountain site, which Mansour said was targeted at the same time of the camp attack.

## Conclusion

After collecting and analyzing the visual documents published on social media platforms and news networks, the Yemeni Archive verified that al-Mazraq camp in Hajjah governate was targeted by air strikes on 30 March 2015.

According to the analyzed evidence and sources, several air strikes targeted the main gate of the Al-Mazraq camp and the registration room between 11:00 and 11:30 am on March 30, 2015, resulting in 29 killed and 42 injured, including women and children, in addition to destruction in camp buildings, the nearby medical clinic, and civilian properties.
Coalition forces and Houthis have accused each other of responsibility for targeting the camp. Several reports have indicated Coalition forces' responsibility for targeting, including the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights report; however, the Yemeni Archive has not been able to find any evidence of the potentially responsible.
