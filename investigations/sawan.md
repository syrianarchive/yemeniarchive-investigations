## Introduction

On April 7, 2019, two explosions occurred in Sawan area east of the capital Sana'a in conjunction with airstrikes around the city by the Saudi-led Arab Coalition. It was not clear what happened as there were many narratives of the incident.

The Yemeni Archive team headed to the impact site, inspected the place, and met residents of the neighborhood to find out the truth of the two explosions. In addition to field research, the team relied on open-source tools to verify videos, photos, and reports posted on the Internet, as well as gathering information from eyewitnesses and analysing media coverage of the incident.

The team concluded that the incident was two explosions struck a Houthi-controlled warehouse on the afternoon of April 7, 2019, between 11:40 and 12:10.  The explosions destroyed houses around the warehouse and four schools. A number of reports indicate that at least fifteen students were killed, and more than 100 students were injured as a result of these explosions. The Yemeni Archive could not pinpoint the cause of the explosions, although there was much information in the reports, they were contradictory, as it turns out that the smoke of the first explosion did not indicate a missile strike.

The Houthis changed the official in charge of statistics and prevented the new official from publishing any information regarding the cause of death.  The Houthis, or Ansar Allah movement, is a Zaidi religious movement based in Saada, north of Yemen, founded in the early 1990s under the name of "the Young Believers Movement" and then Ansar Allah. The movement is known by media as the Houthis after its founder Badr al-Din al-Houthi. The movement is led by Abdul Malik bin Badr al-Din al-Huthi, and it is a major party to the conflict in Yemen, and controls western Yemen from the capital Sana'a to the coast.

## Conflicting information regarding the incident
There were conflicting reports about the explosion in social media and official and local news sites. [Ayman al-Shami](https://www.facebook.com/aymn.alshamy2/posts/2143772315710022) posted two photos on his Facebook account from [this location](https://goo.gl/maps/eXGWGdxu8FBRnCyEA) of what he said was an aerial bombardment on Sawan area.

At 11:46 local time, the Facebook page of the  [ "silent individuals of Imran"](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=409738183149944&set=a.333772017413228&type=3&theater) published a post mentioning sounds of explosions in Sawan area of ​​the capital Sana'a. Later, conflicting news and hypotheses related to the incident followed. Oon his Facebook account, [Mohammed Al-Omari](https://www.facebook.com/mohammdalomary/posts/2405497959482729) posted a video showing the aftermath of the explosion that shook his house. [Asif al-Yamani](https://www.facebook.com/nx.maged/videos/2768959806462557/), a resident of the area, also posted a video taken from [this location](https://goo.gl/maps/VN58W4AxZTopLEpx5) documenting the second explosion. [Another video](http://mubasher.aljazeera.net/news/%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%AF%D9%8A%D9%88-%D9%82%D8%B5%D9%81-%D9%8A%D9%82%D8%AA%D9%84-11-%D8%AA%D9%84%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%B0%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D8%B5%D9%86%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%84%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%A4%D9%88%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A9) published by Al-Jazeera shows traces of glass fragments in addition to the destruction in Al-Ra'ii School. It also shows injured people being treated in a hospital, as well as smoke rising from the debris left by the explosion in the area, which indicates that the used weapon was land-based, not an air weapon.

On the same day, the Ibb governorate's media adviser published a [tweet](https://twitter.com/br3_7/status/1114874873229320192?s=21) confirming an explosion that followed a fire in a warehouse near the school. It shows that this video does not contain any sound of a rocket or any remains.

On the next day; on his Facebook page, journalist Ramah al-Jabri published [a post](https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2352438718121040&id=100000648054657) attached with four videos filmed by different citizens from different locations ([site 1](https://goo.gl/maps/oe8HJiQwZ2jpCTmaA)، [site 2](https://goo.gl/maps/aKvpbYZ8Cmvrcyqr5)، [site 3](https://goo.gl/maps/1ZVeN2sU1JfZdKuL7)، [site 4](https://goo.gl/maps/aWwufq31brkBQDfQA)) trying to prove that what happened was not an aerial bombardment but a fire from somewhere in Sawan and followed by a vast explosion that might have been a fuel station explosion, as there was no sound of flying or shelling before it. In one of the videos, a person can be heard saying that the workshop was burned; he did not say it was bombed. [This video](https://vimeo.com/353768698) shows the explosion from four different angles.

Several Yemeni websites published different information about what happened in Sawan, which increased the inconsistencies. On the day of the incident, [Suhail TV Channel](https://www.facebook.com/suhailchannel/photos/a.1418413265063121/2300881183482987/?type=3&theater) published a post on its Facebook page mentioning the death and injury of a number of female students as a  gas tanker exploded near a girls' school in Sawan neighborhood east of the capital Sana'a.[ Al-Mashhad Yemeni](https://twitter.com/mashhadyemeni/status/1114872883933847553?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1114872883933847553&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.almashhad-alyemeni.com%2F130090) Twitter account published a video circulated by other accounts, filmed [nearby](https://goo.gl/maps/aWwufq31brkBQDfQA) the impact site. On the same day,  [Al-Masira website](https://www.almasirah.net/details.php?es_id=38012&cat_id=3) of the Ansar Allah group reported on the bombing on a school and houses in the region of Sawan by the Arab Coalition, which increased the number of victims to more than a hundred people dead and injured. A few hours after the incident, the [Arab Press](http://arabicpress.net/viewnews.asp?id=983) website published a report: "Three students were killed by a big explosion that rocked Sawan area in Sana'a. The explosion was caused by the burning of the carbon plant warehouse, located next to Al-Ra'ii Girls School in the area and close to the 40th round, and reports of high casualties due to suffocation." A source in Sanaa told "Arab Press" that a big explosion rocked the area of ​​Sawan and smoke plumes from the building of the carbon plant. He said that the factory contains chemicals, and confirmed the killing of three students and the injury of a large number of them, and pointed out that shrapnel scattered to the nearby neighborhoods by the force of the explosion and left houses damaged.

Claims about the cause of the explosion have been increasing, including what was reported by several news websites and TV channels that the explosion was caused by an airstrike launched by the Saudi-led Arab Coalition forces, which Al-Arabiya Al-Hadath TV,  one of the Arab Coalition's media platforms, confirmed.

Later, Al-Arabiya and Al-Arabiya AL-Hadath republished the news of the explosion hourly in all its news bulletins until 1 pm GMT, where the spokesperson of the Joint Command of the Arab Coalition made a voice statement broadcast on [Al-Arabiya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVZYQJlr-pc), [Sky News](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noGW2gxEkfc) and Saudi News channels denying any military operations of the Coalition inside Sanaa, confirming that the operation is limited to the perimeter of the capital.

On the other hand, several [websites](http://tahdeeth.net/news/84215?fbclid=IwAR29witg68FSIbgbH1fxeL6vfVweZCL6qP1iRwKA_9I16YQyaJLqqLHmCmc) published news that the warehouse, the site of the explosion, was used as a weapons factory and a military ammunition depot, which was confirmed by eyewitnesses to the Yemeni Archive team. Residents pointed out that the front of the warehouse was a carpentry workshop as a kind of disguising the purpose for which the warehouse was used. Several eyewitnesses interviewed by the Yemeni Archive team said they did not hear sounds of planes before the first explosion, which the people in Sanaa used to hear during the conflict. Eyewitnesses said they saw smoke rising from the warehouse, and then the flames started to ignite in conjunction with the escape of the workers in the warehouse, and was later followed by the second and the most violent explosion.

It is worth mentioning that some of the neighborhood's residents confirmed that forces of Ansar Allah group gathered at explosion site  and fired warning shots in the air, beat people at the site and then detained a number of people who tried to film the incident on their mobile phones, and transported large quantities of unknown material from the incident site. In addition, a [Human Rights Watch report](https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/05/09/yemen-warehouse-blast-kills-schoolchildren) mentioned that Houthi forces prevented human rights researchers from reaching the area until April 11, four days after the incident.

The Yemeni Archive could not determine the reason for the first explosion due to conflicting official and unofficial narratives. However, through field visits and visual analysis, the Yemeni Archive team found that the human damage and the effects of destruction on buildings were mainly caused by the second explosion.

## Victims and hospitals

In a report published by the Ministry of Public Health and Housing of Ansar Allah group; fourteen people were killed as a result of the explosion. Other sources have confirmed the deaths of sixteen people. [Human Rights Watch's May 9, 2019 report](https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/05/09/yemen-warehouse-blast-kills-schoolchildren#) states that the final death toll is fifteen children and more than 100 children and adults are injured. Khairat Kabalari, UNICEF Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa, stated that “An explosion in Sana'a this week killed 14 children and critically injured 16 others, with the possibility of a higher actual number of dead and wounded children".

The Yemeni Archive team conducted a field visit to the hospitals that received victims of the explosion, especially Al-Haramain Hospital in Sawan area, which received the largest number of them. The team was unable to capture any medical report proving that any of the victims died from dropped munitions near the impact site, because of the presence of a security representative by Ansar Allah group, called "Bashir Najad", who is a full-time employee in charge of recording cases coming to the hospital and prepare preliminary reports of their health status. Some sources say that his appointment came for fear of disclosing any information related to the victims of the incident.

At ["AL-Muttahidoun" Hospital](https://goo.gl/maps/AKnA67kqdZhWzWU9A), also in the same area, which received a number of victims of the incident, the director of the hospital, "Adel al-Ghabri," prevented the Yemeni Archive team from accessing medical reports of the victims of the incident, saying that all they have is submitted to the Ministry of Health, and that the management of the hospital can not talk about this issue at all, and information about the incident is exclusively issued by the Ministry of Health. Medical reports are usually sent from the capital's hospitals to the Ministry of Health every six months, while the Yemeni Archive team requested access to the reports one month after the incident, which means that there was an urgent request for reports regarding this incident.

## The location of the incident and the type of the explosion

In order to determine the exact location of the incident and the type of the explosion, the Yemeni Archive relied on the analysis of images and videos circulating in the media and social media.

The image from [Al Jazeera video](http://mubasher.aljazeera.net/news/%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%AF%D9%8A%D9%88-%D9%82%D8%B5%D9%81-%D9%8A%D9%82%D8%AA%D9%84-11-%D8%AA%D9%84%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%B0%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D8%B5%D9%86%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%84%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%A4%D9%88%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A9)   shows one of the minarets of the Tawhid Mosque behind the building of the Al-Ra'ii School.

In this picture, a mosque appears next to Al-Ra'ii school with two minarets, which corresponds to the Tawhid Mosque in Google Maps, according to the [Yemeni Press website](http://www.yemenipress.net/archives/141547).

In the previous picture, we see trees behind the wall of Al-Ra'ii School (green), Al-Tawheed Mosque (red), and Al-Ra'ii School (blue).

![](/assets/investigations/sawan/image19.jpg)

Based on the source of smoke in the previous picture, it is likely that the explosion was caused by shelling within the yellow-defined area on the following Google map.

In the previous photo from [a video taken inside the school](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPbC7Ru1CB0); the source of smoke is clearly visible. Depending on the direction of the photographer when entering the school, it was possible to locate the room in blue, and the building in red on the map, so the source of smoke is in the area specified in yellow on the following Google map.

In a [video](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=823462281333498) posted on "The explosion now" group on Facebook, smoke appears behind a workshop, followed by an explosion. A sign can be seen within the video contains many words, including "Abdul Hakim Najdi shops" and under it the word "iron" can be read, which is confirmed by [one of the comments](https://www.facebook.com/WeenAlEnfigarAlaan/posts/2110123315947781?comment_id=2110316402595139&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R%2329%22%7D) on the video where the commenter says: "This is a  courtyard that has an iron press."

During a field visit to the impact site, the Yemeni Archive team found the remains of hand grenades, and after analysing one of the used bombs, it found that it had a structure of [Mk 2A1](http://www.inert-ord.net/usa03a/usa2/mk2sp/index.html ) which was developed during World War II by the United States. Research confirms that many countries such as [Iran](http://tgrm.foxed.ca/Americangrenades/Mk%20II/The%20Mk%202%20grenade.html), [China](https://www.jmu.edu/cisr/_pages/research/iraq-oig/05-grenade.pdf?fbclid=IwAR2eaBi2mfz1z3d9sxVlyakTVHnhXU0JXbKmG7NCmrad9FLXagXCvtn-ZPs) and [Israel](http://tgrm.foxed.ca/Americangrenades/Mk%20II/The%20Mk%202%20grenade.html) redeveloped and manufactured these bombs using the same structure and work mechanism, so The Yemeni Archive could not determine the exact source of the bomb.

According to the assessment of the field investigation team; Sawan neighborhood is a newly constructed area, and the explosion caused the destruction of a nearby house inhabited by three families, in addition to severe damage to another house. The explosion also shattered doors and windows, destroyed the fence of the workshop adjacent to the warehouse, the inner room of the workshop, and damaged nearby houses on a large scale.

In addition to the Yemeni Archive photos, some of the owners of the houses adjacent to the impact site publidhed photos showing the destruction in their homes. For example, [Mohammed Hamid al-Husam](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=909679816040573&id=100009956893824) posted photos on his Facebook account saying that his house, thirty meters from the site of the blasts,  suffered significant material damage.
