By collecting, verifying and analysing open source data, Yemeni Archive can conclude that 22 May Hospital was attacked on multiple occasions in 2018 and 2019. The hospital is [located](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hospital+May+22/@14.7888878,43.0025045,20z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x16053b5ef48f0637:0xb5e9110a5bb284af!8m2!3d14.7890751!4d43.0025261?shorturl=1) on Al Khamseen Street in Al Hudaydah, a city in western Yemen on the Red Sea coast.

The hospital was [targeted](https://alamalika.net/site/2019/06/27/%D8%B4%D8%A7%D9%87%D8%AF-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%AF%D9%8A%D9%88-%D9%82%D8%B5%D9%81-%D9%85%D8%AF%D9%81%D8%B9%D9%8A-%D9%84%D9%85%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%B4%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D9%88/) by Houthi forces with artillery shells and heavy weapons. It was [first targeted](https://www.alaraby.co.uk/society/2018/11/7/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D9%88%D8%AB%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%8A%D8%B9%D8%B7%D9%84%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%85%D9%84-%D8%A8%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B4%D9%81%D9%89-22-%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%8A%D9%88-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%AF%D8%A9) on the 4th of November in 2018 and then targeted a [second time](https://www.alarabiya.net/ar/arab-and-world/yemen/2019/03/05/%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%AF%D9%8A%D9%88-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D9%88%D8%AB%D9%8A-%D9%8A%D9%82%D8%B5%D9%81-%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B4%D9%81%D9%89-%D9%88%D9%85%D9%86%D8%B4%D8%A2%D8%AA-%D9%85%D8%AF%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%AF%D8%A9) on the 4th of March in 2019 and then a [third time](https://almashhadalaraby.com/news/101248) on the 26th of June. These attacks show a pattern of systematic attacks on health care in Yemen. Based on the evidence analysed, there were no civilian casualties, but the bombings burned and destroyed the building.

The 22 May Hospital provides comprehensive health care in Al Hudaydah, saving residents from travelling to the capital, Sana'a, in order to receive medical treatment. Forcing it to stop its work causes a major loss to the Yemeni health sector, [according to](https://www.alaraby.co.uk/society/2018/11/7/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D9%88%D8%AB%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%8A%D8%B9%D8%B7%D9%84%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%85%D9%84-%D8%A8%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B4%D9%81%D9%89-22-%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%8A%D9%88-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%AF%D8%A9) Dr. Anwar al-Nahari. Houthi forces and forces loyal to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh took control of the city of Al Hudaydah in October 2014.

## What happened?

In November 2018, the hospital was near the frontline of clashes between Houthi forces and Saud-led coalition forces. A Map of Middle East Wars Facebook [post](https://www.facebook.com/2003991922972471/photos/a.2004000942971569/2005934659444864/?type=3&theater) shows areas where clashes were taking place on the end of the third day since the offensive on Al Hudaydah began. According to the [Almashhad Alyemeni](https://www.almashhad-alyemeni.com/121640) news outlet, Houthi forces stormed the 22 May Hospital and the doctors housing quarters in Al Hudaydah and turned it into a military barracks, then deployed weapons at the hospital yard and on the rooftops. A few days later, the medical staff and patients were forced to leave the hospital as a result of the clashes according to [reports from The New Arab](https://www.alaraby.co.uk/society/2018/11/7/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D9%88%D8%AB%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%8A%D8%B9%D8%B7%D9%84%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%85%D9%84-%D8%A8%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B4%D9%81%D9%89-22-%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%8A%D9%88-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%AF%D8%A9) and [Sky News](https://www.almashhad-alyemeni.com/121640).

On November 9, Houthi forces escaped from the hospital after booby-trapping it and detonating upon departure, according to the [National Resistance Forces](https://twitter.com/nrfyemen/status/1060817123092631553) who tweeted the news. According to the WAM news outlet, in a [report](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pjxbwAhzKQ) published on YouTube, some units of the hospital, such as emergency, reception, intensive care, heart and catheterisation, were destroyed as a result of the fires in the hospital. The hospital then came under the control of coalition forces.

On March 4, 2019, Houthi forces shelled the 22 May Hospital with mortar shells, according to a [Sawt Almuqawama Radio](https://twitter.com/XWqqRz86cehCgGQ/status/1102997640604725252?s=20) tweet the day after the attack on Twitter. News outlets such as [Yemen Window](https://yemen-window.com/posts/81914) and [Sabaq](https://sabq.org/YHvJkh) newspaper reported that Houthi forces bombed the hospital and Ikhwan Thabet mall, located next to the hospital, despite the absence of military targets. Several individuals and news agencies circulated a video showing the moment the hospital was bombed, including [Alwfaq news](http://www.alwfaqnews.net/NewsDetail/CCUv3pIVt9n0cXmBADHezA==) and [Muammar alEryani](https://twitter.com/ERYANIM/status/1103317410411659265?s=20) Yemen's Information Minister.

At midnight on June 26, 2019, several news networks and activist pages reported another bombing of the 22 May Hospital with artillery shells and heavy weapons by Houthi forces, which led to fires that devoured the second and third floors of the building. Shortly after the attack, the National Resistance Forces [posted](https://www.facebook.com/nrfye/posts/703004470119950) on their Facebook page a video by their “military media” showing a fire caused by “the bombing by Houthi forces”.

## When and where did the attacks take place?

To determine the exact location of the target, Yemeni Archive collected visual content from the attacks and, using key objects and attributes at the location, matched them with satellite imagery taken from the 22 May Hospital in Al Hudaydah.

Yemeni Archive could not determine the actual timing of the attack on the hospital but was able to determine the date of the attack by collecting and verifying the first posts which reported the news on social media.

On November 4, [7adramout_net](https://twitter.com/7adramout_net/status/1059145789031628800?s=20) published the first tweet of news that the Houthi forces had stormed 22 May Hospital, transformed it into a military barracks, isolated the emergency staff and detained the doctors and patients inside the hospital.

We confirmed the time using the Timestamp Converter tool. Photojournalist Walid al-Kamal published the first Facebook [post](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=911509972387703&id=100005861262176) of Houthi forces storming the 22 May government hospital also stating that forces had turned it into a military barracks, deployed snipers, isolated emergency staff and detained doctors and patients.

The first footage of the March 2019 attack appeared in a video posted on [The Yemen](https://twitter.com/ElYemenNews/status/1103229476505305088?s=20) Twitter account.

The footage showed that a grass hedge was cut in the form of the hospital's name, May 22. The image was corroborated with one found in [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/place/%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B4%D9%81%D9%89+22+%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%8A%D9%88%E2%80%AD/@14.7890754,43.0025258,3a,75y,90t/data=!3m8!1e2!3m6!1sAF1QipOMMESiHcpr8dZ6Hh0yD4XXuEtYqc3pEsOE6pT6!2e10!3e12!6shttps:%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipOMMESiHcpr8dZ6Hh0yD4XXuEtYqc3pEsOE6pT6%3Dw203-h152-k-no!7i3264!8i2448!4m5!3m4!1s0x16053b5ef48f0637:0xb5e9110a5bb284af!8m2!3d14.7890751!4d43.0025261#).

Photos and videos showed that the March attack occurred when the weather was partly cloudy. To add a new layer of verification, we checked the weather on March 4 using the [Wunderground](https://www.wunderground.com/history/daily/OYHD/date/2019-3-4https:/www.wunderground.com/history/daily/OYHD/date/2019-3-4) tool and found that the weather between 12:00 pm and 3:00 pm, at the time of the video, was indeed cloudy.

On the same day of the incident, the National Resistance Forces posted a video on their Facebook page of the moment of the shelling. Yemeni Archive verified the time the video was published using the Timestamp tool.

For the June 2019 attack, the first [tweet](https://twitter.com/yementdy/status/1143994014796046336) reporting the attack came from Yemen Today and was posted after midnight at 12:26 am on June 27. Yemen Now, another outlet, published [news](https://twitter.com/ALyemennow/status/1144002061182414848) on Twitter of a fire caused by the bombing of the 22 May hospital on June 26th.

The West Coast Liberation spokesperson Wadhah al-Dabish Abu Muhannad posted a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kq3ZfIP7D2w) on June 27 on his YouTube channel showing the hospital's destruction. Alamalika Brigades Media Center also published a [video](https://alamalika.net/site/2019/06/27/%D8%B4%D8%A7%D9%87%D8%AF-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%AF%D9%8A%D9%88-%D9%82%D8%B5%D9%81-%D9%85%D8%AF%D9%81%D8%B9%D9%8A-%D9%84%D9%85%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%B4%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D9%88/) showing the impact of the bombing of the hospital. In the video, a witness says "Houthi forces bombed the 22 May Hospital which led to a huge fire in the hospital’s warehouse but thank God and the Joint Forces and its fire brigades, the fire was extinguished. And as you can see the fire led to the burning of laptops and offices."
