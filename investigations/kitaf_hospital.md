The attack took place in the [district of Kitaf](https://www.google.com/maps/place/17%C2%B002'04.3%22N+44%C2%B006'30.2%22E/@17.0346306,44.1082556,52m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d17.034533!4d44.1084), about 100 km away from Sa'dah governorate in northern Yemen, an area that came under the [control](http://web.archive.org/web/20161219064610/http:/www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21620284-are-they-ansar-houthis-take-over) of Houthi forces in 2014.

## What happened

On March 26, 2019, several activists and news outlets circulated information on social media about an aerial bombardment targeting a gas station near the Kitaf Rural Hospital for Children. The posts claimed that a Saudi-led coalition aircraft launched a guided bomb that resulted in casualties.



That same day, the Ministry of Human Rights in Yemen published a [statement](https://www.facebook.com/413373252161453/posts/1228190434013060/) on their Facebook page about the attack on the hospital which they said was perpetrated by the Saudi-led coalition. Yemeni Archive verified the date of publication of the statement using Timestamp. Yemen News Agency also [reported](https://www.facebook.com/alkhabaralyemenisite/posts/596499847484529?__xts__%5b0%5d=68.ARC8njQfKID7XUD_9SuKy2JdEzA__VnqWcGb9dQT220exyId-wKgY8dUpKTVXrJOp1pPRwAPz7u40srEWVunlzfUFcZ408qu-mUHTZvuxqOsvbTRQlpUYMXqkChPsFPOLCZnxRyZTZRl31D_73L9UwQLi9_QiiaFPMhZvJfnupXnDj6jy98SgLsCFhacbzIxw2_INTpwwoT5Ex4o4jmi8S1y_Ew63o4k-MGVVmJALif7Jd9wuvTiddq_ewCRW05wOTpMPafbv40AY-HvnUz-msQ68d2OAdvrl07BMh88Vu83IHd-I24LuG_XgFH4r82jkt2pvm0Kx9p7SQmwJbCuulU&__tn__=-R) that day that the hospital and the gas station were targeted.

The following day, Al Mashhad Al Yemeni YouTube channel posted a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHSEThNPGdE) of the hospital. In the video, an eyewitness is heard saying: "A Saudi-American enemy warplane, on Tuesday morning on the 26th of March, attacked a station, a hospital and a pharmacy.... There was a market full of civilians ... and their bodies are still under the rubble, so far, we have found seven dead, three injured… and the others are still under the rubble.”

Also on the day after the attack, Save the Children published a [statement](https://twitter.com/SaveUKNews/status/1110672410192293890) on their Twitter account in which they stated that seven people were killed by a bomb that targeted a hospital that supported by the organisation.

Several weeks later, on June 12, the Sabq newspaper published an [article](https://sabq.org/dRY3LH) in which the Joint Incidents Assessment Team (JIAT), a body set up by the Saudi-led coalition to investigate "accidents" in their conduct of the Yemeni war, claimed that there was a malfunction in the warplane’s targeting mechanism. The aircraft allegedly asked for the support of another warplane to direct the bomb to the specified military target.



Video recordings of the aircraft show that it directed the bomb using a targeting laser aied at the military target, which was fighters of the Houthi forces who were hiding under a tree in an empty area about 100 metres away from the hospital. Instead, the missile veered off course and hit the hospital. This led to the destruction of the hospital entrance as well as a small section of the hospital building  and a gas station.

Reuters [reported](https://ara.reuters.com/article/ME_TOPNEWS_MORE/idARAKCN1R92MP) that State Department spokesperson Robert Palladino said the bombing of a Save the Children-supported hospital in Yemen was "awful", and urged the Saudi-led coalition to investigate the incident.
