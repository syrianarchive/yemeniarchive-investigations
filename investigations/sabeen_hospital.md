## What happened

Mansour al-Faqih [posted](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=862701050473744&set=a.560371887373330&type=3&theater) on his personal Facebook page at 11:08 am local time "Students are fleeing their school after submitting their final exams when Saudi-led coalition air force bombed the Central Security Camp at Al Sabeen in Sanaa this morning."

In reports published by [Al Riyadh newspaper](http://www.alriyadh.com/1639290), as well as [the Saudi Press Agency SPA](https://www.spa.gov.sa/1689403), the Saudi-led coalition admitted their responsibility for the attack through statements by the spokesperson of the Joint Incident Assessment Team in Yemen and its legal advisor Mansour bin Ahmed Al-Mansour given at a press conference held on November 19, 2017. The reports read that “the team investigated this incident, and reviewed all documents including procedures and rules of engagement, a schedule of daily tasks, and evaluated the evidence. It was revealed to the joint team based on intelligence collected that there was military activity by the Republican Guard loyal to the former President and supporters of the armed Houthi militia at the headquarters of Special Security Forces Command Camp. The activity was for the purpose of using the command camp to plan military operations. The coalition air force targeted locations inside the aforementioned camp as legitimate military targets, and using targeted bombs, accurately struck the intended targets.![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/__4PMKcM6lRBvhCZajNVGug0PfZs_szZQsfLEON9WeQdhcPkcKkG1vsYTGUSF-oUMNk1qcCH_MKaEX7v9YyFzqQnIQVgZhP7GdP_VbIHj2K4y6Cil905zAC1cYD3GVB-O5Os7RLM)

[Al-Mansour] stated that the hospital was exposed to collateral damage due to its proximity to the target (the command camp) with a shock wave that resulted from the aerial bombardment of the legitimate military target. He pointed out that the investigation concluded that the aforementioned hospital was not subjected to any direct attack by Saudi-led coalition forces. It was also indicated by the Joint Incident Assessment Team that coalition forces were providing adequate assistance in accordance with international humanitarian law and its customary laws in dealing with military objects."

The following photos document damage to parts in the hospital. These images were taken from a [report](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo1kIz1OQYs&app=desktop) published by France 24 on the incident, and from [resident Shaima Abdullah](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1592357754343379/permalink/1683925685186585/)’s personal Facebook page.
