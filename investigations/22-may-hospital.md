# Multiple attacks on 22 May Hospital in Al Hudaydah

  

By collecting, verifying and analysing open source data, Yemeni Archive can conclude that 22 May Hospital was attacked on multiple occasions in 2018 and 2019. The hospital is [located](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hospital+May+22/@14.7888878,43.0025045,20z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x16053b5ef48f0637:0xb5e9110a5bb284af!8m2!3d14.7890751!4d43.0025261?shorturl=1) on Al Khamseen Street in Al Hudaydah, a city in western Yemen on the Red Sea coast.

The hospital was [targeted](https://alamalika.net/site/2019/06/27/%D8%B4%D8%A7%D9%87%D8%AF-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%AF%D9%8A%D9%88-%D9%82%D8%B5%D9%81-%D9%85%D8%AF%D9%81%D8%B9%D9%8A-%D9%84%D9%85%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%B4%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D9%88/) by Houthi forces with artillery shells and heavy weapons. It was [first targeted](https://www.alaraby.co.uk/society/2018/11/7/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D9%88%D8%AB%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%8A%D8%B9%D8%B7%D9%84%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%85%D9%84-%D8%A8%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B4%D9%81%D9%89-22-%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%8A%D9%88-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%AF%D8%A9) on the 4th of November in 2018 and then targeted a [second time](https://www.alarabiya.net/ar/arab-and-world/yemen/2019/03/05/%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%AF%D9%8A%D9%88-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D9%88%D8%AB%D9%8A-%D9%8A%D9%82%D8%B5%D9%81-%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B4%D9%81%D9%89-%D9%88%D9%85%D9%86%D8%B4%D8%A2%D8%AA-%D9%85%D8%AF%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%AF%D8%A9) on the 4th of March in 2019 and then a [third time](https://almashhadalaraby.com/news/101248) on the 26th of June. These attacks show a pattern of systematic attacks on health care in Yemen. Based on the evidence analysed, there were no civilian casualties, but the bombings burned and destroyed the building.

The 22 May Hospital provides comprehensive health care in Al Hudaydah, saving residents from travelling to the capital, Sana'a, in order to receive medical treatment. Forcing it to stop its work causes a major loss to the Yemeni health sector, [according to](https://www.alaraby.co.uk/society/2018/11/7/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D9%88%D8%AB%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%8A%D8%B9%D8%B7%D9%84%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%85%D9%84-%D8%A8%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B4%D9%81%D9%89-22-%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%8A%D9%88-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%AF%D8%A9) Dr. Anwar al-Nahari. Houthi forces and forces loyal to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh took control of the city of Al Hudaydah in October 2014.

## What happened?

In November 2018, the hospital was near the frontline of clashes between Houthi forces and Saud-led coalition forces. A Map of Middle East Wars Facebook [post](https://www.facebook.com/2003991922972471/photos/a.2004000942971569/2005934659444864/?type=3&theater) shows areas where clashes were taking place on the end of the third day since the offensive on Al Hudaydah began. According to the [Almashhad Alyemeni](https://www.almashhad-alyemeni.com/121640) news outlet, Houthi forces stormed the 22 May Hospital and the doctors housing quarters in Al Hudaydah and turned it into a military barracks, then deployed weapons at the hospital yard and on the rooftops. A few days later, the medical staff and patients were forced to leave the hospital as a result of the clashes according to [reports from The New Arab](https://www.alaraby.co.uk/society/2018/11/7/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D9%88%D8%AB%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%8A%D8%B9%D8%B7%D9%84%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%85%D9%84-%D8%A8%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B4%D9%81%D9%89-22-%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%8A%D9%88-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%AF%D8%A9) and [Sky News](https://www.almashhad-alyemeni.com/121640).

  

On November 9, Houthi forces escaped from the hospital after booby-trapping it and detonating upon departure, according to the [National Resistance Forces](https://twitter.com/nrfyemen/status/1060817123092631553) who tweeted the news. According to the WAM news outlet, in a [report](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pjxbwAhzKQ) published on YouTube, some units of the hospital, such as emergency, reception, intensive care, heart and catheterisation, were destroyed as a result of the fires in the hospital. On November 11, Abu Said AlSahel AlGharb posted on his Facebook page a [video](https://www.facebook.com/100029963136597/videos/111844356491002/) of the National Resistance Forces media center, showing the remnants of weapons left by Houthi forces and which was captured by the coalition forces after the hospital came under their control.

  

On March 4, 2019, Houthi forces shelled the 22 May Hospital with mortar shells, according to a [Sawt Almuqawama Radio](https://twitter.com/XWqqRz86cehCgGQ/status/1102997640604725252?s=20) tweet the day after the attack on Twitter. News outlets such as [Yemen Window](https://yemen-window.com/posts/81914) and [Sabaq](https://sabq.org/YHvJkh) newspaper reported that Houthi forces bombed the hospital and Ikhwan Thabet mall, located next to the hospital, despite the absence of military targets. Several individuals and news agencies circulated a video showing the moment the hospital was bombed, including [Alwfaq news](http://www.alwfaqnews.net/NewsDetail/CCUv3pIVt9n0cXmBADHezA==) and [Muammar alEryani](https://twitter.com/ERYANIM/status/1103317410411659265?s=20) Yemen's Information Minister.

  

At midnight on June 26, 2019, several news networks and activist pages reported another bombing of the 22 May Hospital with artillery shells and heavy weapons by Houthi forces, which led to fires that devoured the second and third floors of the building. Shortly after the attack, the National Resistance Forces [posted](https://www.facebook.com/nrfye/posts/703004470119950) on their Facebook page a video by their “military media” showing a fire caused by “the bombing by Houthi forces”.

  

## When and where did the attacks take place?

To determine the exact location of the target, Yemeni Archive collected visual content from the attacks and, using key objects and attributes at the location, matched them with satellite imagery taken from the 22 May Hospital in Al Hudaydah.

Yemeni Archive could not determine the actual timing of the attack on the hospital but was able to determine the date of the attack by collecting and verifying the first posts which reported the news on social media.

  

On November 4, [7adramout_net](https://twitter.com/7adramout_net/status/1059145789031628800?s=20) published the first tweet of news that the Houthi forces had stormed 22 May Hospital, transformed it into a military barracks, isolated the emergency staff and detained the doctors and patients inside the hospital.

While the Yemen channel today posted on Twitter at 11:22 pm local time, her first [tweet](https://twitter.com/yementdy/status/1102665743752146944?s=20) related to the attack of March 2019

The first footage of the March 2019 attack appeared in a video posted on [The Yemen](https://twitter.com/ElYemenNews/status/1103229476505305088?s=20) Twitter account.

The footage showed that a grass hedge was cut in the form of the hospital's name, May 22.

Photos and videos showed that the March attack occurred when the weather was partly cloudy. To add a new layer of verification, we checked the weather on March 4 using the [Wunderground](https://www.wunderground.com/history/daily/OYHD/date/2019-3-4https:/www.wunderground.com/history/daily/OYHD/date/2019-3-4) tool and found that the weather between 12:00 pm and 3:00 pm, at the time of the video, was indeed cloudy.

In the video, a witness says "Houthi forces bombed the 22 May Hospital which led to a huge fire in the hospital’s warehouse but thank God and the Joint Forces and its fire brigades, the fire was extinguished. And as you can see the fire led to the burning of laptops and offices."
