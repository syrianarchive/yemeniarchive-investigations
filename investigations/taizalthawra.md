By collecting and analysing images and videos published on social media and news networks, Yemeni Archive concluded that Al-Thawra Hospital in [Taiz](https://www.google.com/maps/place/%D9%85%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9+%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%B2%D9%8A%D8%A9%D8%8C+%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%8E%D9%85%D9%8E%D9%86%E2%80%AD/@13.5833496,44.0506948,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x161c692afdf672bb:0x800766c2f9603088!8m2!3d13.5775886!4d44.0177989?hl=ar) was attacked on three separate occasions and targeted on each occasion multiple times with rocket-propelled grenades and other munitions. According to the evidence and sources analysed, the vicinity of Al-Thawra Hospital was struck by a number of missiles targeting medical departments, doctors' residences, the hospital gate and nearby houses. Attacks resulted in casualties from civilians, patients and medical staff working in the hospital.

The [first attack](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=996807716998543&set=a.572686366077349&type=3) began at 11:30 pm on June 20, 2015 and continued until 2:00 am the following day, meaning that the attack consisted of two and a half hours of continuous shelling on hospital departments.

The [second attack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQpJ5HFkDE0) took place at 09:00 am on 25 October when a shell landed in front of the hospital gate, killing and wounding several people, and then at 12:00 pm, another shell landed on the left side of the hospital's large building.

The [third attack](https://twitter.com/SkyNewsArabia_B/status/664456454418636800) took place on November 11 at 5:38 pm with a number of rocket-propelled grenades that killed two people and wounded nine others.

The attacks partially destroyed some of the vital sections of the hospital, forcing them out of service. Numerous reports alleged that Houthi forces were responsible. Although Yemeni Archive did not find any open source content attributing responsibility for the attacks, however the attacks were carried out with heavy weapons, tanks and various mortars and took place after Houthi forces [took over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR8K01voz2E) military bases from the Yemeni Army which held these heavy weapons. At the time, Houthi forces also controlled all areas of high elevation overlooking the hospital having expanded their control over various Yemeni cities, including Taiz.

Al-Thawra Hospital is located in the center of the city of Taiz, southern Yemen, and is 286 km from the capital Sana'a. Taiz governorate is experiencing an armed conflict between Yemeni government forces and Houthi forces, who have been seeking control of the city since March 2015.

## What happened?

During 2015, several satellite TVs, news websites, and local activist Twitter and Facebook pages circulated reports that the Al-Thawra Hospital in Taiz governorate was repeatedly shelled by rocket-propelled grenades. Houthi forces fired these shells into vital sections of the hospital and partially destroyed some of these sections, resulting in deaths and injuries. Al-Thawra Hospital in Taiz was systematically targeted throughout the second half of that year.

**The first attack on June 20, 2015**

On June 20, [Abdul Qader al-Junaid](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=996807716998543&set=a.572686366077349&type=3&theater), a Yemeni activist from Taiz, posted on his Facebook page that Al-Thawra Hospital had been shelled indiscriminately by Houthi forces and forces loyal to former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh. The following day, [Taiz](https://www.facebook.com/taizcity.net/photos/a.178312205551472/879220995460586/?type=3&__tn__=-R) Facebook page published on 01:08 am that the ambulance department of Al-Thawra Hospital was shelled. On the same day, [The New Yemeni](https://www.alyemeny.com/news.php?id=3149#.XXO0hNIjTc) website published news of the continued bombing of the hospital by Houthi and Saleh forces, and that shells hit the ambulance department the houses of civilians next to the hospital.

The first news about this attack was Abdul Qadir al-Junaid's [post](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=996807716998543&set=a.572686366077349&type=3) on his Facebook page published at 11:30 local time in Yemen which indicated when Al-Thawra Hospital started to be bombed. To further investigate the time of the attack, the Yemeni Archive investigation team analysed the timestamp of the posts using 4webhelp to determine the timing of publication, and found them to be matching.

On June 23, two days after the first attack, Amin Dibwan published a [report](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um7mpUme8cA&t=26s) by Yemen Shabab  TV on his personal YouTube channel. The report shows the impact of the shells on the hospital building, and features a testimony by one of the hospital staff saying: "At midnight, a shell landed on the surgery unit, which damaged the surgery room, a second on the obstetrics department, a third on the intensive care department, and another one on the radiology department." At the 1:15 mark in the video, shots are heard near the hospital. "As you hear now, the shelling is still going on. At 8:00 am there were 10 sniper shots on the war relief unit. Six shells dropped the hospital glass near us at night and we were on the ground flood of the building," said one patient, who was in a room that was hit by shrapnel.

On June 25, Mujahid al-Salali [tweeted](https://twitter.com/m_alsallaly/status/613833189379850240) photographs showing Al-Thawra hospital doctors’ residences shelled by rocket-propelled grenades.

In the video, one hospital staff member says: “Al-Thawra General Hospital is the only government hospital and now operates at 1% of its capacity. As you can see all the facilities of this big building are closed because of the shelling. There is only a small building that is operating. The departments of major surgeries, gastroenterology, surgery and ophthalmology have been closed. Now it’s only the dialysis unit and the War Emergency Committee which are operational and staffed by a limited number of people who are working voluntarily.”

Reports indicate that the shelling of Al-Thawra Hospital continued until 2:00 am on June 21, 2015. The Nabad Alkarama News Facebook page [posted](https://www.facebook.com/alkarama2015/posts/987187191321882) at 1:42 am local time saying that Al-Thawra Hospital is still under attack by the Houthi and Saleh groups.

## Landmarks and Geolocation

To determine the exact targeted location, Yemeni Archive collected and verified the visual content associated with the attacks, identifying and comparing landmarks and then matching them with the satellite image of the location of Al-Thawra Hospital in Taiz.

Satellite maps show the [location](https://www.google.com/maps/place/%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B4%D9%81%D9%89+%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AB%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%87+%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%B2%E2%80%AD/@13.5861852,44.025377,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x161c68d3953d75f1:0xeb877898c8dbbdd0!8m2!3d13.5861852!4d44.0231883?hl=ar) of the Al-Thawra Hospital in the center of Taiz. The [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=95&v=a5VGpj7S7is) posted by Saleh al-Hakami on his YouTube channel shows some of the landmarks outside Al-Thawra Hospital. We compared images from the the doctors’ residence seen in the report with Google Earth satellite images and found a match, thereby confirming the video. The video also contains an outside shot of the hospital that corresponds to a satellite image of Al-Thawra hospital taken from the same angle.

The photo published by the Media Center of the Popular Resistance - Taiz on its Facebook page, which claimed it was an exclusive picture of the fall of a shell in front of Al-Thawra Hospital also s matches with satellite images on Google Earth. The visual shows “Cafeteria Shabab Taiz” opposite to the hospital gate as well as a high-rise white building. Yemeni Archive was able to locate the site on Google Earth maps as shown in the following image:

![](/assets/althawra-image25.png)  

In the second attack on October 25, 2015, comparing the photos and videos published on the day of the attack with satellite images allows us to determine that the shell landed on the left side of the big building inside Al-Thawra Hospital.

## The impact of the attack and the weapons used

In 2015, the Al-Thawra Hospital was the only government health facility in the region to serve patients and war-wounded, both military and civilian. [TV reports](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5VGpj7S7is) indicate that [several sections](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqtvmk0pHfE) of the hospital were destroyed by the shelling of the hospital. The Red Cross published photos in a [report](https://www.icrc.org/ar/document/yemen-attacks-health-care-facilities-must-stop) they said were photos of one of the bombed rooms.

In one room said to house doctors, a comparison of [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=95&v=a5VGpj7S7is) footage shot from the front entrance and [photos](https://twitter.com/m_alsallaly/status/613833189379850240) posted on Twitter shot from the back corner, show a match.

![](/assets/althawra-image28.png)  

The [images](https://www.icrc.org/sites/default/files/styles/document_photo_gallery_detail_file/public/document/file_list/yemen-shelling-hospital-al-thawra-taiz-2.jpg?itok=iOKAuyIS) published by the Red Cross also matched those of the scene shown in the Yemen Shabab  [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um7mpUme8cA&t=26s).

![](/assets/althawra-image29.png)  

Houthi Violations also published an [image](https://www.facebook.com/Houthis.Crimes.Ye/photos/pcb.1598349507102616/1598349490435951/?type=3&theater) that matched that of Saleh al-Hakami's video.

The following [pictures](https://www.facebook.com/AnadoluAgency.AR/posts/943813435739795?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARD3aWxLIWqJR07feyseniQzjWidj4-KAOLf25JIt3iwBXtG-RdrDqqBH1VckOLHYFrW6gX_hkdKs4-IsorKgk03dEcIdN91Mb3NzQVv59On37sOgel4qA2DQGcPZqEEu9KmpmTi3l6FQwPwEd9uIJlRaRzd10sRa37SoFX6Pj7UO4Mep_TJFaBH1I4dWiBs-vzswGheh8s1qQ8bPJ8FfcEsUa8Uvc8cTicknnJZbSib5IZGN2bAYXMnfvz8eq0eQBYYxRPCaGBXiUD8ZcMCspJSX1fVHRUvQqIrUq_ergwz5x72w3k0AWY3Ikrsd0KKGFLgGEvoZU2s-PAbzZhLFTc&__tn__=-R) are published by Anadolu News Agency on its Facebook page showing the destruction inside Al-Thawra Hospital, followed by pictures taken from news reports mentioned earlier in this investigation.

Most of the allegations in news channels, videos and photos posted on social media said the attack was carried out with mortars and tank shells fired by Houthis forces. Yemeni Archive found several photographs documenting the remnants of the munitions used in the attack. The photos show a rocket-propelled grenade, while one [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5VGpj7S7is) shows the impact of gunshots that hit the hospital's windows, which is consistent with testimonies about the attack indicating that the hospital was shelled with a number of mortar shells and tanks. There were as well as the sound of gunshots heard in another video, and one eyewitness says in this video that "ten sniper shots hit the war relief unit."
